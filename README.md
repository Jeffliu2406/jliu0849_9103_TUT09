## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

For my assignment, I chose Pablo Picassoâ€™s **Dove of Peace** as inspiration. I am drawn to its simplicity, clean lines, and strong symbolism of hope and unity. I plan to incorporate time-based and interactive effects: using time as a variable to shift the background smoothly from day to night, while keeping the dove constant. Additionally, I will animate the wings, making them flap faster when sound levels increase. This will bring the dove to life, creating an engaging, responsive visual experience.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

To achieve this, I am inspired by two p5.js examples:

- **Random walk with color interpolated by frequency**: This example inspires the generative aspect of the wings, allowing random shapes to fill in and appear like growing feathers. I plan to adapt this by limiting the growth area to match the wing structure.

- **Time-based circular clock animation**: This example inspires the smooth transition over time, like day turning into night. I aim to apply a similar gradual color change to the background, synchronized with real-world time, to create a dynamic atmosphere.
